/**
 * Non-blocking / structured-concurrency guard-rails for production code.
 *
 * Heuristic: this matches against `function.text` (the raw source of the
 * function body), so it is a substring search, not semantic analysis. It will
 * also match the literal inside comments or strings, and it cannot resolve an
 * aliased import. Good enough as a guard-rail; extend [forbiddenCalls] with
 * other blocking/unstructured APIs (e.g. `.get(`) as conventions require.
 *
 * Why these literals:
 *  - `Thread.sleep` / `CountDownLatch` — park the calling thread, defeating the
 *    point of non-blocking code.
 *  - `runBlocking` — bridges suspending code into a blocking call, parking the
 *    thread until completion; fine in `main`/tests, a foot-gun in production.
 *  - `GlobalScope` — launches coroutines tied to no lifecycle, so they leak and
 *    swallow failures instead of propagating cancellation. Inject a scoped
 *    `CoroutineScope` instead.
 *
 * `suspend` functions are not checked separately: they are a subset of all
 * functions, and every blocking literal that matters to them is already in
 * [forbiddenCalls].
